The rae-dux is a keyboard inspired by the [[https://github.com/tapioki/cephalopoda/tree/main/Architeuthis%20dux][Architeuthis Dux]] and built using the [[https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava][samoklava workflow]].

*Has yet to be tested printed and tested!*

** Changes from samoklava
- Added a-dux like splay, fitted to my hand
  + Filled in holes that came from the new splay by using the bind functionality
  + *Important*: had to ensure that the MCU footprint was upright otherwise autorouting failed
- Removed case holes and case
